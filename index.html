            <p>I'm a master's student in computer science at McGill University and
            <a href="https://mila.quebec/en" class="noFrills">Mila</a>, where I'm supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/" class="noFrills">
                    Prakash Panangaden</a> and <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/" class="noFrills">Doina Precup</a>.
                I've previously worked with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~bvr/" class="noFrills">Benjamin Van Roy</a> at Stanford on resolving societal disagreements in sequential decision-making, and with Cam Allen and Stuart Russell at UC Berkeley on aligning reinforcement learning agents with underspecified human goals.
                I like research about human-AI interaction because it gets at a simple but open question: what do we really want AI systems to do for us?
            </p>

            <!--
            <p>My recent projects have asked a few simple questions:<br>
            <ul>
            <li><i>Which preference models can AI systems satisfy?</i> Many sequential decision-making algorithms assume that our goals can be captured by a single statistic (sometimes called ``reward'').
                This is often not the case, and I've explored two alternative algorithms that can handle different kinds feedback.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><i>What is the "Helpful and Harmless" tradeoff? What resolves it?</i> After a thorough audit of this alledged trade-off in language models, this seemed less of a fundamental problem and more of a methodology problem.
                I believe that adding structure to the data will help. I've shown that this works for agents in sequential decision-making tasks.
            </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                Outside of academia, I lead a small team of software developers at <a href="https://hortus.ai/" class="noFrills">Hortus AI</a>, an AI governance startup founded by Thomas Krendl Gilbert.
                Weâ€™re building a public-sector AI marketplace that's designed to make partnerships transparent, ethical, and easy to navigate.
            </p>
            <p>I also hold a bachelor's degree in Honours Mathematics from McGill.
                Though I like math and computers, I'm naturally more of an arts-and-crafts person: long before I learned to code, I spent late nights at a sewing machine, making clothes with my friends.
            </p>
